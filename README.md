# CorrectionsLiteracyInitiativePilot-

The Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development (MLTSD) and the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services (MCSCS) partnered to launch the Corrections Literacy Initiative Pilot in spring 2017.  

Administrative data was collected to learn about the demographics of those participating in the pilot. The information from this data will inform policymakers of who is participating in the pilot and whether it is reaching the intended population.

This project provides an assessment of the dataset in terms of completion and/or data quality, describe the participant population (using charts and analytical conclutions), and describes the outcomes of participants at 3 months after completion of the program.
